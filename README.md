# Probability-Calculator

This project simulates drawing colored balls from a hat and calculates the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls. The implementation uses a `Hat` class and an `experiment` function to perform random draws and estimate probabilities.

## Overview

The `Hat` class allows you to create a hat containing balls of various colors. The `experiment` function runs multiple simulations to determine the probability of drawing a specified combination of balls from the hat.

## Features

- Create a hat with a variable number of colored balls.
- Draw a specified number of balls from the hat without replacement.
- Perform multiple experiments to estimate probabilities based on random draws.

## Installation

To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the `main.py` script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hat-probability-experiment.git
cd hat-probability-experiment
